version 1.0:

this is different from the beta version in that 1) if you have a
directory 'cache' in your CICTL_PATH, ci won't run. remove that
directory. 2) the caching system is better. 3) it shouldn't crash
if someone beats up on you network-wise.

version 1.0.1:

i stuck in a signal(SIGPIPE,SIG_IGN) into interface.c so it won't
crash, y'know.

version 1.0.2:

i was informed that I should mention the 'delete' command in the editor's
help command. oops. also, the 'list' command could cause a core dump
in the editor if somebody listed past end-of-file.
also, changed the -l -p and -s start options to -load -panic and -save.
added options -tmpdb -syslog -cictl -mudlib
it oughta start up nicely right out of the package now, write after you
make the sucker.
there was one other bug, you could coredump if the thing is unable
to save the database properly. but that's fixed.

version 1.0.3:
In the Makefile, you can set defines in DEFS= such that the server
won't infinite loop.  CYCLE_SOFT_MAX is the number of interpreter-loops
that will be made in a single thread of execution before the interpreter
barfs, and CYCLE_HARD_MAX is the number of interpreter loops that
will be made over all about-to-be-executed commands and alarms before
the interpreter barfs.

maintenance to the compiler.
