This is version 1.9.5 of NetCI.

Currently, the source code is being maintained by Patrick Wetmore,
and the mudlib is being maintained by Gregory Blake <gblake@nunic.nu.edu>.

There is currently a mailing list for netci.  To join, mail to
netci-list-request@mis.nu.edu and I will add you to the mailing
list.
Documentation is currently minimal, but on most systems you should
be able to compile this just by typing make.  Once the server is compiled
you can edit netci.ini in order to change different system settings.
In order to start up the server, just run netci. (for more help on the
different command line options, type netci -help).

More detailed help will be available in later releases (as I have time to
write it).
